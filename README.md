# Communities I'm Part Of

- **Cola Team (CS2)**: [Discord](https://discord.gg/czP2W5CVx8)  
- **ESPAÃ‘A TEAM PLVS VLTRA (CS:S & CS2)**: [Discord](https://discord.gg/plvsvltra)

# Requirements to Join Your Community

- I should have decent ping on your servers. I live in Spain with a 1Gbps fiber connection. I might make an exception for Spanish-speaking servers.
- Your community should have at least one active server with players. Iâ€™m not looking to help build a community entirely from scratch.
- Iâ€™m especially interested in active CS2 communities to stay motivated and continue developing new game modes.

# What I Offer

Experienced SourceMod developer and server configurator with over 14 years in the field, including around 1 year of modding experience for CS2. I also work as a professional software developer on mobile apps.
- Full free support, including:
  - Setup and configuration of new servers
  - Bug fixing
  - Custom plugin development and new features
  - Optimizations and configuration improvements
- Access to some of my private plugins (not publicly released).
- I can help promote your server by including its IP in posts for my public plugins that use it.

---

# Rules

- I wonâ€™t help copy content from any community Iâ€™m already working with.
- I contribute when I have free time â€” Iâ€™m doing this voluntarily, so thereâ€™s no formal obligation.
- If needed, Iâ€™ll inform you before making changes to your server.
- Mutual trust is essential. Ideally, I would get FTP access to make changes directly, but I understand if you prefer to wait until some trust is built. I can help first, and you can grant access later.

# Why I Participate in Communities for Free

- I enjoy programming for game servers and want the chance to work on diverse projects.
- I want to keep developing SourceMod plugins actively, but only for fun â€” without the pressure of paid commissions.
- I already work as a professional programmer, so money isnâ€™t the motivation anymore. I do this as a hobby, not as a job.
