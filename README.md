# Communities where I am:

* Gaming-force.es
* clanzonazero.com
* Elite Hunterz
* CPH-Gaming.dk
* RPG-Gaming
* PublicOnline
* crazy-ducks.org
* BLACKBIRDS


# Requeriments to have me in your community:

* I should have a decent ping in your servers (I live in Spain with fiber of 600 MB), but I could make a exception in servers that talk my native language (spanish).
* You should have atleast one server with people (i dont want to lose time on setup a community from scratch).


# What I offer:

* A experimented sourcemod coder (and with a real developer job) and servers configurator with 9 years doing servers stuff at your service for free.
* I could give you full support for free.
* I could give you access to private plugins not relased yet.
* I could help you on setup new servers, fix bugs, make new plugins, features, improvements and configs for free.
* I could advertise your server ip in my public plugins post that are using it.


# Rules:

* I will not help you in copy stuff from a community where I am.
* I will help you when I have time (I am working for free so I dont have a real responsability with you).
* I will notify you before do something in your server if you want it.
* You will trust me and I will trust on you. The ideal if that I would have ftp access for do the changes directly in the server but since give me ftp details too soon could be request too much, I can help you first and more later you will give me ftp access.


# Why I want to participate on communities for free:

* Because I like programming in game servers and I would like to have the possibility of program different servers for different people.
* Because I want to continue coding activily sourcemod plugins without the responsability of paid requests, just for fun and when i want.
* Because I would like to continue in the modding world but not as a job, just as a hobby. I have a real programmer job so the money is not a necesity like it was before, now I do modding just for fun.
