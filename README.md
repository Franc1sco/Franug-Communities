### Communities where I am:

* Gaming-force.es
* Elite Hunterz
* CPH-Gaming.dk


### Requeriments to have me in your community:

* I should have a decent ping in your servers (european), but I could make a exception in servers that talk my native language (spanish).
* You should have atleast one server with people (i dont want to lose time on setup a community from scratch).


### What I offer:

* A experimented sourcemod coder (and with a real developer job) and servers configurator with 9 years doing servers stuff at your service for free.
* Full support for free.
* Access to private plugins that not relased yet.
* Setup new servers, make new plugins, features or configs for free.
* I could put your server ip in my public plugins post that are using it.


### Rules:

* I will not help you in copy stuff from a community where I am.
* I will help you when I have time (I am working for free so I dont have a real responsability with you).
* I will notify you before do something in your server if you want it.
* You will trust me and I will trust on you. The ideal if that I would have ftp access for do the changes directly in the server but since give me ftp details too soon could be request too much, I can help you first and more later you will give me ftp access.


### Why I want to participate on communities for free:

* Because I like programming in game servers and I would like to have the possibility of program different servers for different people.
* Because I want to continue coding activily sourcemod plugins without the responsability of paid requests, just for fun and when i want.
* Because I would like to continue in the modding world but not as a job, just as a hobby.
